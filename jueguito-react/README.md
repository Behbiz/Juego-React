Run the application in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will load with a classic hangman game, and you'll have to match the letters, build the word, and answer basic JavaScript questions before moving your head from your shoulders.

good luck!
